                <p>Welcome to my professional webpage! I am Tess Gonda, a senior at Michigan State University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with an expected graduation in May 2026. I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong background in cybersecurity and a passion for developing innovative solutions that enhance security workflows and user experiences.</p>

                <p>During my internship at Epson America, Inc., I gained hands-on experience in cybersecurity operations, where I analyzed email security telemetry, developed Python automation scripts for endpoint management, and performed SOC analysis to enhance security workflows. I've also contributed to machine learning model optimization as a US Rater at Telus Digital, where I evaluated and improved search algorithm performance.</p>
                
                <p>My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages including Python, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, along with ARM Assembly. I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and computer architecture. Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about creative technology projects. I was proud to win the Best Use of FREE-WiLi application award at SpartaHack X for developing thereMINI, a wearable theremin that transforms hand motion into music.</p>
